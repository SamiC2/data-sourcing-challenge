# data-sourcing-challenge
## By Sami Chowdhury
### Columbia AI Bootcamp Week 6 HW

This was a mainly simple assignment, the main thing that took a bit of time was grabbing the data with the NASA API for the CME data. I am now capable of extracting data using API keys with get requests and then cleaning that data. Merging on similar columns is also something I am comfortable with. The class assignments were sufficient enough for me to solve the assignment, so no outide resource was needed. 

**To run this code, after cloning into this repository and changing directory to *data-sourcing-challenge*, please run the following python notebook:**
